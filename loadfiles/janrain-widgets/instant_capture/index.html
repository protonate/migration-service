<h3>Using Instant Capture:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to any website; wait for it to load completely.</li>
<li>Click the "Instant Capture" bookmarklette you created above.</li>
<li>Click on any element on the page to convert it to a Capture Sign In link.</li>
<li>You can also hold shift and click anywhere on the page to make a Sign In link (instead of the above step).</li>
<li>Click the element you chose in step #3 or #4 to launch Capture.</li>
<li>Sign in. Click element again to view profile after sign in finishes.</li>
<li>It is possible to add as many Sign In links as you want as long as you click your bookmark each time you want to add a new link.</li>
<li>Typing a question mark on the page will open up a help screen with this information. The help screen will also expect you to click on an element to convert it.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a little blue "j" which appears in the bottom right corner of the screen when Instant Capture is set up correctly. If the element you take over is a text element, you should see the text change to "Sign In", then later to "Profile" after you finish signing in. Sign In and registration creates and updates real Capture records in the <a href="https://janraincapture.com/applications/bfb2b608-aed4-40aa-837b-d0cdedaaab3f/entities?schema_id=user">Instant Capture Database</a>. You may want to save that link to your bookmarks as well.</p>
